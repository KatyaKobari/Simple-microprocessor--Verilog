# Simple-microprocessor using Verilog.
This project aims to create a simple microprocessor using Verilog code. The 
microprocessor consists of three modules: an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) that performs various 
arithmetic and logic operations, a Register File that stores the data, and an Instruction Format 
module that defines the structure of the instructions. The microprocessor can execute different 
operations depending on the instructions that I provide to it>
